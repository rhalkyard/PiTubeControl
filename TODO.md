# Vague questions and ideas for improvement

* Some emulations appear to take other options. Figure out the rest of them.

* Check for presence of PiTubeDirect and bail out if we don't find one.

* Automatically reset instead of prompting user to press Ctrl-Break? Can't
  decide if this is a good idea or not.

* Is `&2100` a sensible address to load to?

* Offer alternative to `*PiTube OFF` on Master series machines.

* Support running as a sideways ROM (argument-parsing code will need to be
  different). Far too small to live in a ROM of its own, but might be nice to
  incorporate it into a larger collection of tools.
